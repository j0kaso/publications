# Gi-specificity, Kwiatkowksi et al. 2021

Data and scripts for Kwiatkowksi et al. 2021

You can find here scripts and starting structures, trajectories are deposited elsewhere.

Check out the mdsrv [1] session here (http://proteinformatics.uni-leipzig.de/publications/Gi-specificity/) and in more detail here (http://proteinformatics.uni-leipzig.de/mdsrv.html?load=file://_Gi_specificity/session.js).

The circular figures in the paper were made with Observable [2], which are in the analysis folder but can also be found here (https://observablehq.com/@j0kaso/radar-chart-for-the-kwiatkowksi-et-al-2021-gi-specificity-pa).


The folder setups contains the tpr, mdps and itps to reproduce the simulation setups. Additionally setup and production notes are added.



All mentioned analysis scripts (cation-pi-script.py, hbonds-vmd.py, saltbr.py, change-frames.py, hydrophobic2.py, sortcontacts.py) can be found here:

All scripts denoted with g_* are wrappers around GROMACS and written by Alexander S. Rose (deposited here: https://bitbucket.org/hildilab/mdkit)
